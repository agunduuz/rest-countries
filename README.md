# 🔍 Explore Countries! 🌍

I've created an interface where we can retrieve population, capital, and languages of countries using an API. 
Additionally, we can see the neighboring countries of the researched ones. Here, I examined 🇹🇷 Turkey. 
You can explore your dream country or the country you reside in. 
By using the Callback method in JavaScript, I ensured asynchronous functionality. In the CSS part, I utilized Bootstrap to achieve a dynamic design.

Languages I used:
- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**
